# Security Considerations

## Transport Security 
Recommendations for preventing denial of service (DoS) attacks, or restricting transmitted messages are inherited from MLS. Furthermore, message integrity and confidentiality is, as for MLS, protected. 


## Visibility to the Group 

## Visability to Delivery Service

# Extension Requirements to MLS

## Leaf Node Contents

# IANA Considerations 
**[TODO]** Determine an extension code to use
