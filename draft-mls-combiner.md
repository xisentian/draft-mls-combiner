--- abstract 
This document describes a protocol for combining a standard MLS session with a post-quantum MLS session to achieve flexible and efficient hybrid post-quantum security. Specifically, we describe how to use the exporter secret of a PQ MLS session, i.e. an MLS session using a PQ KEM and PQ signature algorithm, to seed PQ confidentiality and authentication guarantees into an MLS session using traditional KEM and signatures algorithms. By providing flexible support for on-demand traditional-only key updates (a.k.a. partial updates) or hybrid-PQC key updates (a.k.a. full updates), we can reduce the bandwidth and computational overhead associated with maintaining a PQC-only MLS session by providing flexibility as to how frequently they occur while maintaining a tighter traditional post-compromise security epoch length. 

[**TODO**: *Consider adding a statement to say how this combiner generalizes combining of two (or more?) arbitrary MLS sessions*].

# Introduction

A fully capable quantum adversary has the ability to break fundamental underlying cryptographic assumptions of traditional Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and Digital Signature Algorithms (DSAs). This has led to the development of post quantum (PQ) cryptographically secure KEMs and DSAs by the cryptographic research community which have been formally adopted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), including the Module Lattice KEM (ML-KEM) and Module Lattice DSA (ML-DSA) algorithms. While these provide PQ security, ML-KEM and ML-DSA have significantly worse overhead in terms of keyshares size, signature sizes, and CPU time than their traditional counterparts. Moreover, research vectors on side-channel attacks, etc., have motivated uses of hybrid-PQ combiners that draw security from both the underlying PQ and underlying traditional components. A variety of hybrid security treatments have arisen across IETF working groups to bridge the gap between performance and security to encourage the adoption of PQ security in existing protocols, including MLS protocol [RFC9420]. 

Within the MLS working group, there are several topic areas requiring the use of post-quantum security extensions: 
[Copied from draft-mahy-mls-xwing]
1.  A straightforward MLS cipher suite that replaces a traditional KEM with a hybrid post-quantum/traditional KEM.  Such a cipher suite could be implemented as a drop-in replacement in many MLS libraries without changes to any other part of the MLS stack. The aim is for implementations to have a single KEM which would be performant and work for the vast majority of implementations. It addresses the the harvest-now / decrypt-later threat model using the simplest, and most practicable solution available.

2. Versions of existing cipher suites that use post-quantum signatures; and specific guidelines on the construction, use, and validation of hybrid signatures.

3. One or more mechanisms which reduce the bandwidth or storage requirements, or improve performance when using post-quantum algorithms (for example by updating post-quantum keys less frequently than traditional keys, or by sharing portions of post-quantum keys across a large number of clients or groups.)

This document addresses the third topic of theses work items.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The terms MLS client, MLS member, MLS group, Leaf Node, GroupContext, KeyPackage, Signature Key, Handshake Message, Private Message, Public Message, and RequiredCapabilities have the same meanings as in the [MLS protocol] <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html>.

# Notation 

**Traditional MLS Session:** An MLS session that uses a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based KEM as described in RFC9180. 

**Key Derivation Function (KDF):** A Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)-based expand-and-extract key derivation function (HKDF) as described in RFC5869. 

**Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM):**  A key transport protocol that allows two parties to obtain a shared secret based on the receiver's public key. 

**Post Quantum (PQ) MLS Session:** An MLS session that uses a PQ-KEM construction, such as described by FIPS 203 from NIST. 



# Protocol Execution 

The combiner protocol runs two MLS sessions in parallel, performing synchronizations from the PQ session to the traditional session [**TODO** and book-keeping operations (for fork resiliency?)]. The mandatory synchronization operations exports state information from the PQ to the traditional session for group operations. This synchronization process is mandatory for adds and removals but is optional for updates to allow for flexibility. Due to the higher computational and output sizes of PQ KEM (and signature) operations, it may be desirable to issue PQ updates less frequently than the traditional updates. Thus, for the most part, both sessions may be treated as black-box interfaces so we only highlight operations requiring synchronizations in this document.

## Updates

Updates MAY be *partial* or *full*. For a partial-update, only the traditional session's epoch is updated following the proposal-commit sequence from Section 12 of RFC9420. For a full-update, an update is first applied to the PQ session and then an `exporter_secret` is derived from the PQ session. Then, the same sender updates its traditional session's group secret, injecting the PQ exporter_secret as a PSK into the key schedule, and commits the update with a PreSharedKey proposal (8.4, 8.5 RFC9420). Receivers process the PQ commit and the traditional commit to derive the new epochs in both sessions.

## Adding and Removing Users
Adding and removing users is done per [RFC9420], except that the joiner is added into two groups: the PQ group and the traditional group. [TODO: add indicator that they are joining the hybrid session.]. 
When the joiner issues its first update, it MUST perform a full update, applying both a PQ and traditional update as described above, using the exporter_secret and PSK proposal options.


### Adding a User

User leaf nodes are first added to the PQ session following the sequence described in Section 3 of RFC9420 except using PQ algorithms where HPKE algorithms exist. For example, a PQ KeyPackage one containing a PQ public key signed using a PQ DSA, must first be published to the Delivery Service (DS). The extensions field of the GroupInfo MUST contain a HPQMLS flag **[TODO: How to indicate two groups? GroupID+Ciphersuites? Information leakage considerations]**. Then the associated Add Proposal, Commit, and Welcome messages will be sent and processed in the PQ session according to Section 12 of RFC9420. The same sequence is repeated in the standard session. Finally, in order to synchronize the group membership change, the new member MUST issue a full update sequence as described above. 

<!--Similar to the full-update, the sender of the Add proposal will update its standard session's key schedule using the PSK generated by the `exporter_secret` of the new epoch in the PQ session. Then the sender generates an Add proposal in its traditional session for the same user leaf nodes and includes a PreSharedKey proposal its Commit and PreSharedKeyID in its Welcome message. [**TODO: Please check the standard session join using a PSK! I'm thinking this might save some BW**]-->

-->

### External Joins

External joins are used by members who join a group without being explicitly added (via a add-commit sequence) by another existing member. The external user MUST join both the PQ session and the traditional session using the appropriate GroupInfo object to create an external Commit. As stated previously, the GroupInfo used to create the external commit MUST contain the HPQMLS flag [**TODO: Decide on flag/value**]. Then, the new member MUST issue a full hybrid update as described in [Updates](#updates).

### Removing a Group Member

User removals MUST be done in both PQ and traditional sessions followed by a full hybrid update as as described in [Updates](#updates). 


# Application Messages

The HPQMLS combiner serves only to provide hybrid PQ security to a classical MLS session. Application messages are therefore only sent using  the `encryption_secret` provided by the key schedule of the classical session according to Section 15 of RFC9420. 

## TODO? Epoch Agreement (Fork Resiliency) 


# Security Considerations

## Transport Security 
Recommendations for preventing denial of service (DoS) attacks, or restricting transmitted messages are inherited from MLS. Furthermore, message integrity and confidentiality is, as for MLS, protected. 

# Extension Requirements to MLS


# IANA Considerations 
**[TODO]** Determine an extension code to use
